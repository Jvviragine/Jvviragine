Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Bachelor student at Maastricht University ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, currently interning at Aucos AG ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, where I'm developing their Interpretable Predictive Quality Control system from scratch.

### ðŸ’»Internship Experience

Aucos is an Aachen-based engineering technology company focused on the automation of surface treatment plants
and the delivery of process optimization solutions to large industrial clients. In Aucos' production lines, products
undergo multiple sequential steps of chemical treatment before being inspected for quality control. The presence of
advanced sensors, such as those measuring temperature, conductivity, and pH, provides a rich data source for
developing a predictive quality control model. At the end of the production line, products are manually inspected,
and a quality label is recorded in the database. This labeling process, combined with the sensor data, enables the
application of classification techniques to predict product quality.

The Project I have been working at for the past 1.5 years has been to build an interpretable predictive quality control system from scratch, allowing Aucos to predict in real time the quality of their production batches before it even finishes going through all chemical treatment steps.

By having a reliable and interpretable predictive quality control system, not only we are able to make predictions with confidence, but even more fundamentally, understand the underlying process deeper, allowing us to improve it and make better products. 

My Internship is part of a 2 Years Honours Program at Maastricht Univeristy called KE@Work. In this program, we work an average of 2.5 days a week during 2 full years, meaning that our workload is divided between 50% of studies and 50% of practical work.
